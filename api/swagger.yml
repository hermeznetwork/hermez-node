    This API server is the layer that allows 3rd party apps and services interfacing with the coordinator to explore, monitor and use the Hermez rollup.
    Example of these apps are:
    * Wallet: send L2 transactions, check balance, ...
    * Explorer: List transactions, slots, batches, ...
    * Exchange integrations
    
    All the endpoints that return a list of undefined size use pagination. Unless the opposite is explicitly said.
    All the retunred items are ordered by ascending chronological order. 
    This may not be trivial to deduce as the atributes used to order are not timestamps but the protocol ensures that those atributes follow the mentioned chronological order.
    Each endpoint description clarify this in the `offset` description.

    The response of the calls to these endpoints will always include a `pagination` object that includes `totalItems` and `lastReturnedItem`.
    To iterate over the items the following query parameters are used:
      - `offset`: Indicates the first item that will be returned. Defaul 0. Incompatible with `last`.
      - `limit`: Indicates the maximum number of returned items. Default 20. Maximum 2049.
      - `last`: When true the last `limit` items are returned. Default false. Incompatible with `offset`.

    Iterate items in ascending chronological order:

      1. Call the endpoint with no `offset` nor `last`.
      2. Call the endpoint with `offset=<lastReturnedItem + 1>` until `lastReturnedItem == totalItems - 1`.

    Iterate items in descending chronological order:

      1. Call the endpoint with `last`.
      2. Call the endpoint with `offset=<min(0, lastReturnedItem - 2*limit)>`. Once the `calculated offset == 0`, it will be known that that call will return the first item and therefore no subsequent calls need to be done.
    If the `totalItems` change while iterating, it means that new items have been added at the end of the list. To fetch this items, use the following: `offset=<first received lastReturnedItem + 1>`, and from there iterate as decribed in *Iterate items in ascending chronological order*.
    
    **Note:** The returned list will alway be in ascending chronlogical order, so the returned arrays must be iterated from end to start in order to achieve reverse chronological order.
    
    **Note:** Pagination safety can be affected by Ethereum reorgs. In most of the cases this means that the last page can be changed, but older items should be safe.
