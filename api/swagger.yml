    This Hermez node API is the layer that allows 3rd party apps and services to interface with the node to use the layer two features of the Hermez rollup.
    Example of these apps are:
    * Wallet: send L2 transactions, check balance, ...
    * Explorer: List transactions, slots, batches, ...
    * Exchange integrations

    Note that some of the interactions with the rollup must be done using the Ethereum network directly.
    Another way to integrate with the rollup is to [deploy a node](github.com/hermeznetwork/hermez-node/) and connect directly to its PostgreSQL database.
    
    ### Pagination
    
    #### Usage

    All the endpoints that return a list of undefined size use pagination. Unless the opposite is explicitly said.
    In order to use pagination, three query parameters are used:
    * `fromItem`: indicates the first item to be returned. In general, this parameter shouldn't be provided in the first call to the endpoint, and use the `itemId` of the last returned item (+/-) 1, if the order is (ascending/descending).
    * `order`: all paginated items are ordered chronologically. However, the specific fields to guarantee this order depend on each endpoint. For this purpose, `itemId` is used (itemId follows ascending chronological order except for unforged L1 user transactions). If the parameter is not provided, ascending order will be used by default. 
    * `limit`: maximum amount of items to include in each response. Default is 20, maximum is 2049.
    
    Responses for those endpoints will always include a `pendingItems` property. This property includes the amount of items that are not fetched yet. This can be used to:
    * Calculate the amount of items that match the filters: `totalItems = length(alreadyFetchedItems) + pendingItems`
    * Know when all items have been fetched: `if pendingItems == 0 {/* all items have been fetched */}`

    #### Reorgs and Safety

    Since all the items are ordered chronologically, there are no safety problems when fetching items in ascending order, except for reorgs (more on this later).
    On the other hand, when iterating in descending order, new items will be added at the beginning. This doesn't cause any safety problem, but to get those new items, it's necessary to start querying without the `fromItem` set to `pagination.lastItem`.
    To handle reorgs, the `itemId` can be used since it will change. This is important since other identifiers may be the same but with different content. As an example, if batch 424 gets reorged, it will be deleted, but eventually, a new batch 424 will appear with potentially different content. However, these two batches number 424, will have different `itemId`.

    ### Signatures

    There are three endpoints that require signatures:
    * POST /account-creation-authorization: signed using an Ethereum key.
    * POST /transactions-pool: signed using BJJ key.
    * PUT /transactions-pool: signed using BJJ key.

    It's recommended to use the official SDKs for [Go](https://github.com/hermeznetwork/hermez-go-sdk), [JS](https://github.com/hermeznetwork/hermezjs) and [Flutter](https://github.com/hermeznetwork/hermez_flutter_sdk).
    If for some reason the previous options doesn't suit your usecase, you can implement the signatures following the spec for [account creation authorizations](https://docs.hermez.io/#/developers/protocol/hermez-protocol/protocol?id=regular-rollup-account) and [L2 transactions](https://docs.hermez.io/#/developers/protocol/hermez-protocol/protocol?id=l2)

    More details on how to sign will be provided soon.
